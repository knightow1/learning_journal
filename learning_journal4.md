#Learning Journal 4- Code 201

Today's assignment was a tough one since we've started to ramp up to what may be the stressful week of the course. With all the requirements for the assignment Andy and I teamed up to pair program. This was a huge success since we able to catch each others mistakes, in our logic and in our code. Together we were able to share what we came up with other students to help them through the struggles they were having. I'm also really proud of quickly I whipped up a decent looking stylesheet no problem.

Moving forward I'm glad to have this bulk of this tough assignment done in a reasonable amount of time so i can work on setting up my new laptop for school tomorrow. It's a tough week to look ahead at with all I know (and don't know) we'll be covering. My hope is that by the end of the week I'll still be just as exciting as I was when i started codefellows.
