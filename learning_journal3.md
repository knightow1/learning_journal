#Learning Journal 3 - 201

Today was super stoked that we got cover some real CSS. I was very impressed that Andy figured out how to format the page in 10 mins for the in-class assignment. The tougher part of the day we was the assignment when we needed to put functions inside of functions. The hard part was how to get a value of only the 0 index of an array and add or multiply those number together.

Moving forward I'm excited to work on my about me page and have some fun for the weekend.
