#Learning Journal 1  - Code 201

Today I learned about the basics of HTML, CSS and JS. The lesson was more of a refresher from what I had already covered in the Codecademy classes and the readings from the John Duckett books. No matter what this was a good moment to confirm what I thought I knew about the three different languages. I made sure to take a lot of notes about the subjects that would be most important for now and topics we would cover later.

 So far Javascript has interested me the most because of how much you can do with it. Moving forward my number one short term goal is understanding functions better and how best to create and use them. I'm excited for the next two weeks when we will cover these much more in depth. Hopefully the task won't be too tall for me.
