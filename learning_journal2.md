#Learning Journal 2 - 201

##Today was a good day. 

I was able to get the assignment down and connect with some different students. I'm was very happy that git and loops clicked for me from the start. Really I think that's luck more than anything. If there is a good set of instructions or an example to follow I can usually make good sense of it from there.

Looking ahead I want to get tips and learn knew ways to format and simplify my code. I'll really be happy once we start putting everything we learned in the pre-work all together and into practice.
